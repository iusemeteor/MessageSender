# Discord Message Sender

This script allows you to send messages to a Discord channel using Discord's API. You can send a single message, spam messages with a specified delay, or trigger message sending with a hotkey.

## Features

- Send a single message to a Discord channel.
- Send multiple messages with a specified delay between each message.
- Use a hotkey (`F6`) to resend the last message without re-entering details.
- Fetch user token directly from token.txt.
